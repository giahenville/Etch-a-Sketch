# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my version of the Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project. Try it [here](https://giahenville.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/) I hope you enjoy!

## Description:

The user can draw on a canvas in the browser by moving their mouse over the grid. This is currently only implemented through the web browser.

## Features:

* Change pen color using color picker
* Add shading
* Use multi-color pen mode
* Use eraser
* Clear canvas
* Change grid size

## Skills I learned:

* How to use CSS Grid
* How to use javascript to create divs and change their sizes
* How to add event listeners to change the colors of elements when the mouse hovers over them
* How to update the grid size using an event listener
* How to add and remove classes from elements dynamically using Javascript

## Improvements:

* Adjust canvas size to fit the screen; currently, it extends beyond the viewport.
